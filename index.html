    <div class="infobox">
      <p> This is a random German philosopher who was a professor at the University of Königsberg. 
        He used the term <em>schema</em> to mean the way a non-empirical concept is associated with the mental image of an object. <br>
        Here are some of his works:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Critique of Pure Reason</strong> - best known work which was followed by Critique of Judgment and Critique of Practical Reason. <br>
          Proposed that results from geometry and simple physics might be a potential synthetic a priori truths. <br>
          The section “The Metaphysical Deduction” explains the evolution of categories (pure concepts of understanding).<br>
          Statements such as "the soul is simple" and "the soul is a substance" are "paralogisms" of its title subject.<br>
          A priori judgments debunk proof of God’s existence.  </li>
        <li><strong>Perpetual Peace</strong> - a world without war based on constitutional republics</li>
        <li><strong>Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals</strong> - outlined the <em>categorical imperative</em><br> (one should only act if that action should become universal law)</li>
        <li><strong>Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment?</strong> - he used the phrase <em>sapere aude</em> (dare to know)<br>
          saying that one should think autonomously</li>
        <li><strong>Inaugural Essay</strong> - difference between intellectual thought and sensible receptivity</li>
    </ul>
