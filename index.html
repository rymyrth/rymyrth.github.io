    <h2>July 7, 2020: Immanuel Kant</h2>
    <p> This is a random German philosopher who was a professor at the University of Königsberg. He used the term <em>schema</em> to mean the way <br>
      a non-empirical concept is associated with the mental image of an object. Here are some of his works:<p>
      <ul>
        <li>Critique of Pure Reason - best known work which was followed by Critique of Judgment and Critique of Practical Reason. <br>
          Proposed that results from geometry and simple physics might be a potential synthetic a priori truths. <br>
          The section “The Metaphysical Deduction” explains the evolution of categories (pure concepts of understanding).<br>
          Statements such as "the soul is simple" and "the soul is a substance" are "paralogisms" of its title subject. </li>
        <li>Perpetual Peace - a world without war based on constitutional republics</li>
        <li>Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals - outlined the categorical imperative</li>
    </ul>
