      Also Rymyrth needs to make a table of contents.</p>

    <div id="kant" style = "background-color: #d8dfe3; padding: 10px; border:solid; border-width:2px; border-color: #272a2b"><p> This is a random German philosopher who was a professor at the University of Königsberg. He used the term <em>schema</em> to mean the way <br>
      a non-empirical concept is associated with the mental image of an object. Here are some of his works:<p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Critique of Pure Reason</strong> - best known work which was followed by Critique of Judgment and Critique of Practical Reason. <br>
          Proposed that results from geometry and simple physics might be a potential synthetic a priori truths. <br>
          The section “The Metaphysical Deduction” explains the evolution of categories (pure concepts of understanding).<br>
          Statements such as "the soul is simple" and "the soul is a substance" are "paralogisms" of its title subject. </li>
        <li><strong>Perpetual Peace</strong> - a world without war based on constitutional republics</li>
        <li><strong>Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals</strong> - outlined the categorical imperative</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Here is some more info about him that I'm too lazy to format properly.<br>
      This thinker’s Inaugural Essay distinguished between intellectual thought and sensible receptivity.<br>
      He expanded on Swedenborg’s nebular hypothesis of the formation of the solar system. <br>
      In one work, this philosopher defined the Enlightenment by the phrase "Sapere aude," or "Dare to know," maintaining that one should think autonomously. <br>
      this author of Groundwork on the Metaphysics of Morals, in which he introduced his categorical imperative,<br>
      also wrote a work splitting synthetic and analytic judgments into a priori and a posteriori types. 
      <br><br>
      AND
     <br><br>
      One work by this author requires a world of constitutional republics to attain the namesake state of Perpetual Peace.<br>
      The first formulation of one of this ethical theories states that one should only act if that action should become universal law,<br>
      while his most famous work includes a debunking of the ontological proof of God's existence in the course of studying a priori synthetic judgments. <br>
      The formulator of the categorical imperative, name this German philosopher and author of Critique of Pure Reason and Critique of Practical Reason.</p></div>
